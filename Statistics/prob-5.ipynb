    "#### Q-5. A certain city has two taxi companies: Company A has 80% of the taxis and Company B has 20% of the taxis. Company A's taxis have a 95% success rate for picking up passengers on time, while Company B's taxis have a 90% success rate. If a randomly selected taxi is late, what is the probability that it belongs to Company A?"

    "**Ans:** we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that a late taxi belongs to Company A given the provided information.\n",
